# Waiting List Prioritizing Software

WPS (Waiting List Prioritizing Software) is intended to automate the process of enrolling students from waiting list into a course, thus, making the process fast, efficient and reliable. The current process is manual in nature and is therefore time-consuming and demands a lot of effort from the staff side. WPS helps the staff by generating a priority list of students who are in the waiting list based on specified criterion (units completed, visa status, units currently enrolled) in no time. Then, the staff can choose the students to be enrolled in the course from the generated priority list. This software gives a fair chance to students to get enrolled in their preferred course based on the criterion. Thus, this software lessens the burden of the staff and makes the process faster for the students by utilizing the technologies at their full potential.
WPS is written using a popular object-oriented language Java. It uses one of the most popular and widely used databases MySQL. The interface is fairly simple to use and every effort is been made to keep it secure and reliable.
